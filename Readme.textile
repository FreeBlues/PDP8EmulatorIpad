#PDP-8 Emulator for iPad

This is my PDP8 Emulator for the iPad.  It's written in Lua using the Codea platform.
All the resources it uses are standard with Codea so you shouldn't have any difficulty
running it as is.  

More documentation is coming...

### Note on code structure:

Yes, it's test driven.  I wrote a little unit testing utility that makes it pretty easy.   It's far from perfect, but it's workable.

The GUI stuff is not test driven, but the processor and bit manipulations are.  I test the GUI stuff in a very tight loop, in the TDD style, but there's no good way
to write unit tests against the Codea platform.  That doesn't matter too much since the edit/test loop is so fast when working with the GUI.

Refactoring in this environment (iPad screen, and bluetooth keyboard) is not ideal.  There's no refactoring browser, 
nor any really helpful tools.  Even selecting code on the screen is a pain.  Fingers are nowhere near as precise as a mouse.
Therefore, my functions are generally too large, and I have a significant backlog of cleanup to do.  But I'm doing it.  _Be patient._
